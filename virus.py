	The Virus class is at the third highest level in the viral simulator. The 
	Virus class is a metaphor for any pathogen; because this simulator is being
	written first for a Viral pathogen as opposed to a different one, we will 
	for now stick with the Virus class name. In the future, this will be 
	generalized to a generic Pathogen class.
	TODO: RENAME VIRUS CLASS TO PATHOGEN.

	----------

	ATTRIBUTES

	- STRING: id
		a unique identifier for the virus object, generated by concatenating a 
		random number with the current local time, and then hashing it.

	- LIST OF OBJECTS: segments 
		a list of viral Segment objects that belong to the virus.
	
	- VARIABLE: parent
		a variable that references another virus as its parent, if descended 
		from a single virus, or a tuple of two viruses, if it is a reassorted 
		progeny.
	
	- TUPLE: burst_size_range
		a two-tuple that specifies the minimum and maximum number of viruses 
		that come out of one replication cycle.

	- FLOAT: replication_time
	 	an integer that specifies how long it takes (in minutes) for one 
	 	replication cycle to take place.

	----------

	MAIN METHODS

	- mutate:
	 	a method that mutates all of the segments present in the virus 
	 	according to the mutation rate of the virus.

	- replicate: 
	 	a method that returns a copy of the virus. The mutate function is
	 	guaranteed to be called.

	- generate_progeny:
	 	a method that returns a list of progeny that were replicated out of the
	 	virus.

	The methods described above are the main and important methods; the other
	methods in this class are mostly helper methods that do getting/setting of 
	attributes (with type checking for setters).
