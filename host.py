class Host(object):
	"""
	The Host object is the second highest level object in the simulator. Metaphorically, the Host object is the host for a pathogen. At each 	discrete viral generation time, the Host can allow Virus(es) to generate  progeny inside of itself. Additionally, at each time step, the host can remove a proportion of viruses from itself. The dynamics of viral removal can be configured by subclassing the Host object. The dynamics of viral progeny generation can be configured by subclassing the Virus object.

	Host objects have to exist within an environment. This is compulsory to be able to track where a virus was sampled. 

	For the purposes of knowing the ground truth of infection, Host objects are capable of keeping track of who they were infected by and when. Currently, this is kept track of as two individual variables. In the future, in order to generalize this to multiple infections, this will be kept track of as a single dictionary, where the keys are the time of infection, and the values are the Host objects that were the source of infection.

	Sampler objects can interact with Host objects. Sampler objects can either sample everything from the host, or it can sample a subset of viruses. The number of viruses that are sampled at each sampling event can be configured by subclassing the Sampler class.
